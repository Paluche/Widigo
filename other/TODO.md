Notes about the project
=======================

#Google Maps or OpenStreetMap?
I have a preference for the Map of OSM, but GMaps seems to be easy to use, or
at least more popular.

#Interesting Features
Step counter embedded as Android sensor

#TODO
- Think about layouts.
- Receiving Activity updates.
- Get a layout with the google Maps.
- Get a menu, where we select whch activities we save.

#The datas
Save the datas under the format of tracks containing for the Activities:
    - IN_VEHICLE, ON_BICYCLE and ON_FOOT
      a list of points with the time
    - STILL
      the position time of start and time of end
    - UNKNOW and TITLING
      nothing, we will not save the datas in this case.

# What We do with the datas.
Display the tracks.
Have a menu displaying the tracks saved between two dates.
