Notes about the project
=======================

#Google Maps or OpenStreetMap
I have a preference for the Map of OSM, but GMaps seems to be easy to use, or
at least more popular.

#Interessting Features
Step counter embedded as Android sensor

#TODO
- Think about layouts
- Find the feature that returns the current activity (which is the main
  purpose of the project)

#Next objective
I want as first step to have a working app, with a map and indicating our
current location on the map.
